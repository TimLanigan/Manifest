Manifest
========

A clean and simple Wordpress theme

Sometimes you just need to pull a Jack Burton and say... "What the hell..."

I've posted up the in-progress version of the new Manifest Wordpress theme. Take a test drive and let me know what you think. Here's a few things to note:


- It's not done. There as a bit of funkiness and some things I need to rework, but nothing deal breaking.</li>
- It's built from the scratch and doesn't use anything from the previous Manifest.</li>
- It's built using [underscores](http://underscores.me/) as the starter template.</li>
- [Masonary](http://masonry.desandro.com/) is used for the footer sidebar and archives.</li>
- The Archives template is just a big sidebar, so you can make it however you see fit.</li>
- [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) is used for the social icon fonts.</a>
- The CSS is compressed and built from Sass files. I haven't included the Sass files yet because they're a mess and will change... a lot. If you want to make customizations, I suggest overriding with your own CSS or use Jetpack (which is what I do here).
- The Sass files will be released once they're in good shape.</li>
- It's responsive for mobile device, which the kids love these days</li>

You can view a [demo here](http://beta.jimbarraud.com/manifest/), and it's also the same theme that drives this site. Take it for a spin if you're so inclined and let me know of any feedback you have.
